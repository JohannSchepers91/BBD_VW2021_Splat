# BBD Vac Week 2021 - Team 4

## The problem
- We need a bursary program applicant test.
- Must be fair to all levels of students applying for a bursary.
- Grading should be automatic.
- The test should test logical thought processes and attention to detail.

## Our solution: Splat

Splat is a proof of concept puzzle solving game, that combines colour based puzzle game mechanics with pseudo-code blocks.
